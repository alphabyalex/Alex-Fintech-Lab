Hello! Thank you for visiting my GITHUB!

Here are some notes explaining my current projects that are in process / compelted. 

1. Calculator_Risk.py is a script that analyzes all the assets in "assetlistall"
 and computes various results into a CSV callde asset_results.CSV. This does take awhile to run so keep that in mind.
 Unfortunately, this data will have to be re-ran every so often to keep up with up to date stats.
The current asset_results is out of date. 

 2. Filter_risk.py is a file part of Calculator_risk. After all the info for the assets has been retrieved and computed
 filter_risk applies a filter for all the assets. using my algo, it will sort the near 10,000 stock tickers into the most viable
 in terms of long term investment based on many factors. This list is outputted in a way thats easy to copy paste.

 3. IPO-Project.py is a script that is in process, the goal is to create a script that will quickly retrieve and analyze data
 for companies that are soon to go public and allow the user to use this data and analysis to make an investment decision
 for an IPO. In this project I want to compare a new "in-flight" company with similar comparable companies and account for 
 differences to make these investment decisions easier for traders.
